turrnut: Ansh this is the other developer for beacon
turrnut: Mr. tuvalutorture
turrnut: Attachments
turrnut: also, here's the ISO file for the OS
turrnut: when emulating, attach an empty fat32 image file, see the README( for more info
tuvalutorture: hello human across the country and hello human that I know not of
tuvalutorture: tervetuloa
ansh_58656: hello tuvalutorture and TURRNUT
ansh_58656: guys see ts
ansh_58656: reply tuvalutorture
ansh_58656: hello tuvalutorture
ansh_58656: u online tuvalutorture
tuvalutorture: bro it was 3 am in my time zone
tuvalutorture: I was sleeping
turrnut: it was 6am in mine
tuvalutorture: I saw that vid before :D
ansh_58656: It was around 4:00 pm
ansh_58656: In my zone
turrnut: oh ok lol, because tuvalutorture lives in western US and I'm in eastern US
ansh_58656: Me India
tuvalutorture: ah I see
tuvalutorture: like 12h ahead?
ansh_58656: Yeah could be
turrnut: no it would be 13h
ansh_58656: I sent at exactly 3:41 pm
turrnut: oh then it would be 12
tuvalutorture: 12:30 then
ansh_58656: What the time rn
turrnut: 10AM for me
tuvalutorture: 7:00 am for me :P
ansh_58656: Here 7:30 pm
turrnut: Speaking of time, y'alls time actually make sense because you dont use daylight savings
ansh_58656: Daylight saving???
ansh_58656: What does that mean
ansh_58656: Idk lol
turrnut: some countries move their clock one hour forward in the summer
tuvalutorture: daylight savings time is basically when the entire US decides to change their clocks by an hour for no reason every 6 months (I think)
ansh_58656: Ok
turrnut: the US uses daylight savings except for Arizona and Hawaii, and tuvalutorture lives in Arizona
ansh_58656: Now i know
turrnut: yea
tuvalutorture: other countries participate in this barbaric shit???
turrnut: ys
turrnut: yes
ansh_58656: Californication
turrnut: Daylight saving time by country
turrnut: Daylight saving time (DST), also known as summer time, is the practice of advancing clocks during part of the year, typically by one hour around spring and summer, so that daylight ends at a later time of the day. As of 2025, DST is observed in most of Europe, most of North America and parts of Africa and Asia around the Northern Hemisphere summ...
tuvalutorture: dear gott kill me now
tuvalutorture: im so glad to live in AZ
ansh_58656: I wouldnt even see ts
ansh_58656: My countrys not included
turrnut: indeed
ansh_58656: So when are u guys upgrading beacon
tuvalutorture: define upgrade
turrnut: I'm envious
ansh_58656: Lol
turrnut: like adding features maybe?
ansh_58656: Lol
ansh_58656: U dont know that fr
tuvalutorture: no I mean im asking what you mean by saying define
tuvalutorture: as in - what is your definition in this context
ansh_58656: Upgrading like adding features and things
ansh_58656: Like making a file explorer ummmm a notepad
ansh_58656: Sonethings like that
turrnut: we could add more file editing
ansh_58656: Yup
turrnut: andor networking
ansh_58656: I saw that ur help 4
ansh_58656: The disk opts dosent work
turrnut: do you have an empty image file when emulating?
tuvalutorture: do you have a drive mounted?
turrnut: it's in image.zip
tuvalutorture: also
tuvalutorture: file disk Io is
tuvalutorture: janky
tuvalutorture: to say the least
ansh_58656: Yeah now i rember its in qemu
ansh_58656: Thats the problem i think
ansh_58656: I tested in qemu
ansh_58656: Btw bye i gtg stidy for exams
tuvalutorture: adios mate
ansh_58656: So byr for now
ansh_58656: Umm i dint see ur full dict
ansh_58656: What does adios mean
ansh_58656: Hello
ansh_58656: TURRNUT
tuvalutorture: Adios is goodbye in Spanish
ansh_58656: Ok
ansh_58656: Idk spanish
ansh_58656: Bye
tuvalutorture: bye
ansh_58656: Bye
ansh_58656: Hello
ansh_58656: I ll also learn c
tuvalutorture: hello
ansh_58656: I only know cpp and python
tuvalutorture: eh then you're already halfway there i'd say lol
ansh_58656: How
ansh_58656: Idk c
ansh_58656: Oh u mean bcz of cpp
ansh_58656: Idk i have never use c
tuvalutorture: cause CPP is just built on top of C - all C code is CPP code
tuvalutorture: they share a lot of similarities
tuvalutorture: and python is somewhat similar in some ways (different in others too)
tuvalutorture: so i'd say in terms of how to write C you're kinda partially there already
tuvalutorture: just need to adapt to specifically C quirks
ansh_58656: U joined chadderbox
tuvalutorture: yep
ansh_58656: Ok
ansh_58656: Hmm
ansh_58656: What do u think about asm
ansh_58656: People say its hard but i think its kind of ok
ansh_58656: Not that hard
tuvalutorture: not hard necessarily
tuvalutorture: just
tuvalutorture: ...painful
tuvalutorture: would be the right term
tuvalutorture: in my opinion
ansh_58656: Its jus moving values to different regsiters
ansh_58656: Btw i loved that laptop img u sent on chadderbox
ansh_58656: I love retro things
tuvalutorture: yeah but for anything remotely complex it's a LOT of moving values - so at least from my experience it stacks up very quickly
tuvalutorture: like its not hard
tuvalutorture: just a lot of manual stuff
tuvalutorture: thank you :D
tuvalutorture: i too enjoy retro things
ansh_58656: Idk what more to talk about
tuvalutorture: idk either lol
ansh_58656: Yeah
ansh_58656: Yeah
ansh_58656: tuvalutorture whats ur age
tuvalutorture: 14, what's yours?
ansh_58656: 11
tuvalutorture: O-O
ansh_58656: Whats TURRNUT
ansh_58656: Age
tuvalutorture: i think he's 15
ansh_58656: Oh one yr bigger than u
ansh_58656: U guys are 3 and 4 yrs bigger than me
tuvalutorture: yes
ansh_58656: How did u get into programming
tuvalutorture: through turrnut
tuvalutorture: i wanted to be able to contribute to beacon
tuvalutorture: so i learned C
ansh_58656: I aked turrnut and he said idk
ansh_58656: I said u are in politics how did u get into coding and then he said idk
tuvalutorture: to be fair some people just do it for fun or don't remember how they got into it
ansh_58656: Ik how i got into it
ansh_58656: I remember
ansh_58656: Bcz i jus started at 10
ansh_58656: Yrs
tuvalutorture: i think i got into it around 12-13
ansh_58656: Many ppl do it for job but i and think u guys also got into it for fun
tuvalutorture: yeah
tuvalutorture: i find it kinda fun to just build stuff ykyk :P
tuvalutorture: maybe i might do it for a job later though
ansh_58656: Waht the meaning of dream of Californication
tuvalutorture: its a lyric from one of my favorite songs
ansh_58656: Ill build a startup or start a game studio
ansh_58656: Or make an os for money
ansh_58656: Like windows with u guys
tuvalutorture: honestly probably same here
ansh_58656: Lets make a utube group channel
ansh_58656: Jk
ansh_58656: If i do
ansh_58656: If i do : )
ansh_58656: Then it sends
tuvalutorture: try typing :)
ansh_58656: :)
ansh_58656: Ok
ansh_58656: Hmmmm
ansh_58656: I kept my orignal name
ansh_58656: In discord
ansh_58656: In which class are u guys
tuvalutorture: what doth thou mean
ansh_58656: Class like the school class
tuvalutorture: uuuhhh i mean like
tuvalutorture: i have a few classes
tuvalutorture: if you're asking what year i'm in (like what grade)
tuvalutorture: 9th grade high school
ansh_58656: Yeag grade
tuvalutorture: then yeah 9th grade year 9
ansh_58656: My exams are starting from September
tuvalutorture: i have no idea when my exams happen
tuvalutorture: they usually happen in like april tho
ansh_58656: Mine 1st sem in like September and 2nd sem in like jan to feb
ansh_58656: U have an mac on the table
tuvalutorture: no its just a monitor
tuvalutorture: not a Mac
turrnut: yea cuz assembly is like different for different CPU architectures
turrnut: yes
turrnut: also tuvalutorture you got into programming through me? I thought you already knew python
turrnut: also Ansh in India is it that a grade is divided into a few classes and then you stay in that class and teachers come into the classroom
turrnut: because I used to go to school in China and that's how it worked
turrnut: but then in US it's the students that move around instead of teachers
ansh_58656: Yeah dont u have sections there on the grade like there's a class like 5 then it is divided into like secs like a,b,c,d
ansh_58656: Oh that's cool
ansh_58656: But here we sit in the classroom and teachers come
turrnut: ah I see so it's the same system as China
ansh_58656: Hi TURRNUT
turrnut: yea
turrnut: hello
ansh_58656: U guys work on pc or laptop
ansh_58656: I work on laptop
tuvalutorture: literally my entire programming experience is
tuvalutorture: scratch - C
tuvalutorture: no python up in my brain
ansh_58656: I know python
ansh_58656: It's very easy
turrnut: ah ok
tuvalutorture: pc
turrnut: I learned Java, then Python and JavaScript, then C
turrnut: laptop
tuvalutorture: I have heard that
ansh_58656: tuvalutorture u have like te retro laptop how much u got it for

turrnut: (joke)
ansh_58656: Ohhh
ansh_58656: Wth
ansh_58656: What do u guys think the hardest lang is
tuvalutorture: like 200 usd
tuvalutorture: those things are honestly expensive to buy in working condition
tuvalutorture: no dude its obviously COBOL
ansh_58656: Who gives u that much money
ansh_58656: I have saved my relatives money that they give and its around 150 usd
tuvalutorture: me selling other retro computers online

ansh_58656: many ppl - question - what is the most worst thing in the world , answer - nuclear war , me - question - what is the most worst thing in the world answer - getting an error in asm
ansh_58656: many ppl in my class think they are programmers bcz of the robotics lab but its till block coding and when i tell em i kniw coding in python there 1st question - what is python? after i tell em its a programming lang they think im lying bcz im just a 11yr old kid that studies in 5th grade
ansh_58656: guys
ansh_58656: anyone online
ansh_58656: TURRNUT
ansh_58656: tuvalutorture
turrnut: hello
turrnut: ok so technically they consider block code languages languages, but come on as people who have touched text based languages we all know that block code aren't real languages and it's basically for little kids to start learning to code
turrnut: and yea it seems they're too ignorant to know python is a thing
turrnut: you're ahead of people in your age group
turrnut: wait till you do more C and gets Segmentation Faults...
ansh_58656: Ok it sounds painful fr
tuvalutorture: segfaults make me wanna P U K E
turrnut: SAME
ansh_58656: i am learning segmentation rn and i just dont get aything
tuvalutorture: like x86 segmentation?
ansh_58656: idk
ansh_58656: yeah i think so
tuvalutorture: yep
tuvalutorture: real mode addressing is hell
tuvalutorture: I would know
tuvalutorture: we love Turbo C
ansh_58656: i dont get anything
ansh_58656: turbo c????
tuvalutorture: a compiler for C on MS-DOS
tuvalutorture: which is 16-bit real mode
ansh_58656: i just use gcc
ansh_58656: ok
ansh_58656: now ik
ansh_58656: what are talkin about?

tuvalutorture: very good point
ansh_58656: indeed
tuvalutorture: consider
tuvalutorture: the following:
tuvalutorture: solar panels
ansh_58656: and
ansh_58656: just solar panel what bout night
tuvalutorture: fun fact
tuvalutorture: any electricity not used while using solar panels (like if I used 1000w but they provided 2000w per hour)
tuvalutorture: gets sent to the electric company
tuvalutorture: and they send that electricity BACK at night
tuvalutorture: and actually if you still dont use it
tuvalutorture: you get paid the value of that electricity
ansh_58656: what are u typing its taking an eternity
ansh_58656: u live with ur parents
tuvalutorture: boyo

turrnut: unless I board a plane and fly for like 5h
tuvalutorture: unless one of us hops on a plane to the other
turrnut: idk how long actually
turrnut: he can't really do that cuz he has 4 pets
ansh_58656: it will take me 1 day to there

tuvalutorture: we dont talk about that
ansh_58656: noo
ansh_58656: bruh what
tuvalutorture: I do unironically eat paper
turrnut: ah
tuvalutorture: on god
turrnut: PAY THEM IN TURRCOINS
ansh_58656: hmm
turrnut: yes!!?!?
ansh_58656: thats a good idea
tuvalutorture: commit levitation I do
turrnut: say like, I'll pay you 10,000(but in Turrcoins)
ansh_58656: which gpu intergrated or dedicated TURRNUT
turrnut: which is 10
turrnut: I don't think I have one
turrnut: actually integrated
ansh_58656: same here
ansh_58656: nestle crunch
tuvalutorture: nestle is evil
tuvalutorture: but their products are yummy
ansh_58656: yup
ansh_58656: yummers
turrnut: nestle is the name of my 8th grade math teacher
turrnut: and also a food brand
turrnut: ofc
ansh_58656: wth so sad he was crunched
tuvalutorture: yeah the company is evil as fuck
ansh_58656: jk :)
tuvalutorture: rip to 8th grade math teacher
turrnut: actually her name is nestler and not nestle but close enough
tuvalutorture: then I revoke my RIP
turrnut: when did you make that logo
ansh_58656: chatgpt
tuvalutorture: TURRNUT dont we actually have a beacon logo
turrnut: yea
turrnut: it's fine tho we can have this for the GC
ansh_58656: ok
ansh_58656: whos the 3rd guy
ansh_58656: Attachments
turrnut: some random person in the internet
ansh_58656: like me
turrnut: actually tuvalutorture did u nuke the CSA thing
ansh_58656: CSA??????????
turrnut: if so then he basically didn't actually have any survived contributions
tuvalutorture: eh I can go back and add his contribution back
tuvalutorture: in the form of a built in app
turrnut: why did u nuke the CSA though :(
turrnut: yea maybe you should
ansh_58656: CSA??????????
turrnut: add it as built in app
turrnut: so SIMAS is compiled to CSA bytecode, which stands for Compiled SIMAS
turrnut: there used to be CSA support in beacon
tuvalutorture: it was weird, buggy, and a hackey solution
ansh_58656: OH HE HELPED IN SIMAS
turrnut: no it's not, the compiler handled imports
tuvalutorture: at the end of the day we should focus on actual features
ansh_58656: YEAH POSITIVE
ansh_58656: THINGS
tuvalutorture: you had to restart the os just to load in a new app
tuvalutorture: and the way the OS handled shit was weird in my opinion
tuvalutorture: we should be able to make something better in the future I promise
ansh_58656: whens the future coming???
turrnut: in the README yes, but he also ported it into C
ansh_58656: tuvalutorture eat cat food and start on the os
turrnut: no, I mean like SIMASJS, for beacon we prob don't need the compiling
turrnut: just an interpreter or JIT works
turrnut: and yes I agree we could make something better, maybe just add CMAS directly to beacon
tuvalutorture: heres the thing
tuvalutorture: it wasnt SIMAS CSA files
tuvalutorture: it was just C code compiled into apps
tuvalutorture: they just shared the nae
turrnut: I c
tuvalutorture: name
ansh_58656: yeah ts where i dont know anything
turrnut: mb I forgor lol
ansh_58656: or understand
ansh_58656: hows it ur bad mb bcz idk anything
turrnut: I forgot that the beacon CSA isn't actually SIMASJS CSA
turrnut: well at least we still have the BrainF I mean, BoyFriend programming language in beacon
ansh_58656: hhh
ansh_58656: brainfuc---
tuvalutorture: the way it worked was
tuvalutorture: - compiled c code
tuvalutorture: - a python script would find the size
tuvalutorture: - it would make a header with the size ands header
tuvalutorture: - the OS would load it to a pre-set memory address
tuvalutorture: - execute
ansh_58656: woowwww
ansh_58656: cat whattuvalutorturesaid.txt
turrnut: ok in that case adding CMAS would be better
ansh_58656: i wanna make a compiler in c
ansh_58656: how much time would that take
ansh_58656: i wonder
tuvalutorture: the issue was it was weird, buggy, relied on SERIAL TRANSFER (which is slow and hard to get on proper hw without buying cables)
tuvalutorture: it als didnt work with our hdd support
tuvalutorture: I had to update two headers manually every time we added a new function
tuvalutorture: it ran in ring 0 so it would allow the user to do anything
tuvalutorture: and also it was written by ChatGPT so everything looked fine but wasnt
ansh_58656: chatgpt???
ansh_58656: wth
turrnut: do you mean compile to machine code? if you do use LLVM or it's really difficult
tuvalutorture: yeah when I wrote that I didnt know a lot of c so I used ChatGPT sometimes
ansh_58656: no like makin my own lang
turrnut: I can confirm since I can't even get it to work on windows
ansh_58656: serial tranfer like serial like on the usb ports u guys kiddin me?
turrnut: yea but are you doing a compiler or interpreter
ansh_58656: need to think bcz compiler is faster
ansh_58656: but interpreted is also good
turrnut: also guys should we just make everything ring 0 only like templeos for the funnyz
ansh_58656: wdym??
tuvalutorture: as in COM1
turrnut: if you compile to native machine code it's really hard, but if you use C to do it it's easier because you can use LLVM
ansh_58656: yeah com3 serial ports
tuvalutorture: nah it should be ring 3 when we can afford to write it because yk why
ansh_58656: yeah using cpp only
ansh_58656: what are u guys talkin bout??
tuvalutorture: look up cpu privilege rings
tuvalutorture: its a protected mode 32 bit thing
ansh_58656: oh i asked chatgpt now ik
ansh_58656: what were u guys doin me com ports
tuvalutorture: This meme went quite popular during July-August 2021 and i decided to finally upload a full video (without that weird black and white watermark in it) version of this meme.
tuvalutorture: Music is Heartaches by Al Bowlly. And for those wondering... i am the creator of the original meme. It just flew under my head back on my EATEOT times.
ansh_58656: bro what are u sending
ansh_58656: and seeing after eating cat food
turrnut: trust me, this is only the tip of the iceberg on how weird this guy is
ansh_58656: ok
ansh_58656: so u ofc know him more than me
ansh_58656: give that ram
ansh_58656: to me
ansh_58656: why u baking it
tuvalutorture: just the tip
ansh_58656: ayo wth
ansh_58656: are u thinking bout
ansh_58656: turrnut which company laptop
turrnut: chat is this dirty mindedness
ansh_58656: and tuvalutorture is it a prebuilt or custom build
ansh_58656: yeah i think
tuvalutorture: Attachments
tuvalutorture: custom
ansh_58656: hhhhhh
ansh_58656: hhhhh
ansh_58656: wth
turrnut: which I have? I have a HP and a lenovo
ansh_58656: a sleeper build
tuvalutorture: precisely
ansh_58656: or u didnt have money to buy the case
tuvalutorture: nah I just didnt wanna buy a new case
ansh_58656: i have a dell
tuvalutorture: besides I like this better
ansh_58656: i wanted acer alg
ansh_58656: tuvalutorture
tuvalutorture: sup
tuvalutorture: i do wanna make it GUI
tuvalutorture: i really do
ansh_58656: me too
ansh_58656: but idk anything
tuvalutorture: but GRUB kinda doesnt wanna cooperate with video mode switching
ansh_58656: there its 8 pm right
ansh_58656: grubs in linux too right
tuvalutorture: yea
tuvalutorture: yerp
tuvalutorture: 9 am for you?
ansh_58656: yup
ansh_58656: what for TURRNUT
ansh_58656: in which country he lives
tuvalutorture: 11:30 am for him i think
tuvalutorture: we both live in the US but he's across the country so he's in a different time zone
ansh_58656: there its saturday rn
tuvalutorture: yep
tuvalutorture: pm
ansh_58656: its sunday rn here
tuvalutorture: i see
ansh_58656: do you actually like cat food
tuvalutorture: no it was a joke lmao
ansh_58656: ok
ansh_58656: u should focus on the cursor first in the os
tuvalutorture: wdym the cursor
ansh_58656: mouse
tuvalutorture: ah
tuvalutorture: but like
tuvalutorture: interrupts and irq's are hell
ansh_58656: yeah
ansh_58656: interrupts
ansh_58656: are bad as hell
ansh_58656: :
ansh_58656: :
ansh_58656: who would actually remember those
tuvalutorture: and also
tuvalutorture: like quite honestly
tuvalutorture: my attention is not going to beacon rn
ansh_58656: yeah ik
ansh_58656: side projects
tuvalutorture: like this
tuvalutorture: Attachments
ansh_58656: 19days
tuvalutorture: aye
ansh_58656: what is this lemme try this
ansh_58656: infinite errors
ansh_58656: Attachments
tuvalutorture: yeeeerp
tuvalutorture: it wont
tuvalutorture: compile with gxx
tuvalutorture: gcc
tuvalutorture: it's not
tuvalutorture: designed to
ansh_58656: with which
ansh_58656: turbo c
tuvalutorture: yes
ansh_58656: or whatever u use
tuvalutorture: Attachments
ansh_58656: which one should i download
tuvalutorture: both
ansh_58656: ok
tuvalutorture: dosbox to run turbo c
ansh_58656: u didnt add an backdoor right
tuvalutorture: ofc not
ansh_58656: how do ik
ansh_58656: what u tyoin
ansh_58656: typing
tuvalutorture: instructions to actually run it
tuvalutorture: idk how to prove it???
ansh_58656: ok
ansh_58656: nvm
ansh_58656: jk :)
tuvalutorture: ask turrnut
ansh_58656: why?
tuvalutorture: i swear on my life it's safe
ansh_58656: bro i was jk
tuvalutorture: he also downloaded it
tuvalutorture: i didn't know fr
ansh_58656: i downloaded it before i told u
tuvalutorture: do you still need instructions
tuvalutorture: how to do it:
tuvalutorture: - install dosbox
tuvalutorture: - unzip turboc.zip
tuvalutorture: - open dosbox
tuvalutorture: - type in mount c the folder containing turboc folder, NOT turboc itself
tuvalutorture: - type C:
tuvalutorture: - type cd turboctc
tuvalutorture: - type tc
tuvalutorture: - press altf
tuvalutorture: - press load
tuvalutorture: - load main.c
tuvalutorture: - press altr
tuvalutorture: - press run
ansh_58656: ok
ansh_58656: i have it in this folder then i should type mount c and then
ansh_58656: Attachments
tuvalutorture: yeah like the folder that holds the turboc folder
tuvalutorture: for example if it's in C:userskidcadownloads i'd type that
tuvalutorture: not C:userskidcadownloadsturboc
ansh_58656: ok
ansh_58656: whos kidca
tuvalutorture: that's what im saved as on my pc

ansh_58656: Attachments
ansh_58656: ik that alr
tuvalutorture: alright
ansh_58656: we need to add
tuvalutorture: so type C:
tuvalutorture: then CD to TURBOCTC
tuvalutorture: and then type TC
ansh_58656: then
ansh_58656: Attachments
tuvalutorture: why are there two turbo c folders
ansh_58656: idk
tuvalutorture: it should just be C:TURBOCTC
ansh_58656: eh
ansh_58656: leav iut
ansh_58656: leave it
tuvalutorture: i mean yeah
tuvalutorture: but you will need to change a setting in turbo c
ansh_58656: ok
ansh_58656: what to do after this cd tc
tuvalutorture: are you in turbo c yet
tuvalutorture: like it should look like a blue text editor
tuvalutorture: just type TC
ansh_58656: Attachments
tuvalutorture: yesss
tuvalutorture: ok
tuvalutorture: go to options
tuvalutorture: Attachments
tuvalutorture: change those 3
tuvalutorture: to C:TURBOCTURBOCTCinclude or lib or whatever
ansh_58656: Attachments
tuvalutorture: yeah like that
tuvalutorture: now go to file
tuvalutorture: load main.c
tuvalutorture: and then go to run
tuvalutorture: and run it
tuvalutorture: actually also go to options and save those options
ansh_58656: how to load a file
tuvalutorture: where are you at rn
ansh_58656: i nsaved thos opts
tuvalutorture: ok go to file
tuvalutorture: there should be an option to load
ansh_58656: how to go up
ansh_58656: Attachments
tuvalutorture: press altf
tuvalutorture: those letters are highlighted to show which key to press with alt

tuvalutorture: yayyyy
ansh_58656: after 1000eternitys
ansh_58656: with my slow brain
ansh_58656: i finnay ran the program
tuvalutorture: what doth thee thinketh of it
ansh_58656: how to color block
ansh_58656: i could never make ts
tuvalutorture: what doth thee mean
tuvalutorture: like how do you place pixels?
ansh_58656: yup
tuvalutorture: either use your mouse (while holding left click)
tuvalutorture: or use the arrow keys and space
ansh_58656: Attachments
tuvalutorture: changing the colors you can use p to switch to the color picker and p to switch back
tuvalutorture: or you can use the mouse ofc
ansh_58656: mouse in dos
tuvalutorture: yep
ansh_58656: nvm
ansh_58656: i ll use keyboard
tuvalutorture: may i ask the issue?
ansh_58656: hmm i think i saw ur real face pic
ansh_58656: nah nothin
ansh_58656: juts bcz mouse is in other rrom and im too lazy to go there
tuvalutorture: ah ok
tuvalutorture: wait you don't use the mouse???
tuvalutorture: like is it not plugged in or smth???
ansh_58656: its wireless
ansh_58656: its a laptop bruh
ansh_58656: not a pc
tuvalutorture: to be fair some people use wired mice with laptops
ansh_58656: ik
ansh_58656: i also like that mouse
ansh_58656: but i just removed the dongle
tuvalutorture: ah ok
ansh_58656: i also had one
ansh_58656: but i opened it up
ansh_58656: to interfere it with arduino
tuvalutorture: i see
ansh_58656: but i nedded an usb shield that i didnt have
tuvalutorture: ahh
ansh_58656: u havr an arduino
tuvalutorture: no
tuvalutorture: but i have like
tuvalutorture: 6 raspberry pi picos
ansh_58656: gimme one
ansh_58656: jk :)
ansh_58656: i want a rasberry pi 5
tuvalutorture: yea
tuvalutorture: those things are cool
ansh_58656: i like it bcz it is programmable with micropy
tuvalutorture: i like it
tuvalutorture: cause small
tuvalutorture: and C
tuvalutorture: (i know not python)
ansh_58656: arduino also can be programmed in c
ansh_58656: and in cpp
tuvalutorture: fair
tuvalutorture: idk
tuvalutorture: i don't find a need for an arduino personally
ansh_58656: i bought bcz it comes with kit
ansh_58656: and i didnt find a rasberryy pi pico kit
ansh_58656: or esp 32 kit
ansh_58656: u have pi pico w
ansh_58656: or normal pi pico
tuvalutorture: nah not the W
tuvalutorture: just normal ones
ansh_58656: i always wanted wifi and ble
ansh_58656: when dou sleep
tuvalutorture: since rn its the weekend like
tuvalutorture: not until 7 am
tuvalutorture: ususally i sleep around midnight tho
ansh_58656: huhuhuhu
ansh_58656: ok
ansh_58656: i thought u sleep at 7am
tuvalutorture: as in
tuvalutorture: 7 am
tuvalutorture: the next day
ansh_58656: ur pc build is crazy
ansh_58656: i wanted and rtx 6000 ada plus amd threadripper pro
ansh_58656: yeah but i dont have money
tuvalutorture: say you need it for schoolwork j
ansh_58656: yeah
ansh_58656: with 512 gb ram
ansh_58656: for word
ansh_58656: to open in 1 ns
ansh_58656: actually 0.1 ns
ansh_58656: or 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 ns
tuvalutorture: nah with the 96mb of cache the threadripper 9995WX has it would've already opened before you thought about it
ansh_58656: yeah thatd be crazy
ansh_58656: then i would train neural nets on it
ansh_58656: and then ill make an ai better than openai chatgpt
tuvalutorture: i would prolly just play balatro ngl
ansh_58656: it would be named beacon ai
ansh_58656: -3
ansh_58656: cz of 3 ppl
ansh_58656: beacon ai 3 has been launched
tuvalutorture: i see
tuvalutorture: yummers
ansh_58656: yup
tuvalutorture: welp i'm going to go to quiktrip
tuvalutorture: y'all'all want anything j
ansh_58656: to touch grass
ansh_58656: yeah
tuvalutorture: no
tuvalutorture: to buy a gallon of soda
ansh_58656: a threadripper
ansh_58656: and a 6000 ada
ansh_58656: have u ever touvhed grass
tuvalutorture: like twice
ansh_58656: i havent
ansh_58656: like 0.1 time
ansh_58656: u have siblings
tuvalutorture: nope
ansh_58656: ok u with very good luck
ansh_58656: TURRNUT what bout u have any siblings?
tuvalutorture: he does not afaik
ansh_58656: afaik????
tuvalutorture: as far as i know
ansh_58656: ok
ansh_58656: i have sisters
tuvalutorture: do you get along with them
ansh_58656: yeah
ansh_58656: no
ansh_58656: i dont tgink so
ansh_58656: one is 5 yrs elder than me
ansh_58656: and one is my twin
tuvalutorture: i see
ansh_58656: go and get soda for me rn
tuvalutorture: only if you cover the cost of shipping
ansh_58656: no bruh i dont have money
ansh_58656: and the can should be crushed by then
tuvalutorture: then no soda for u
ansh_58656: for TURRNUT
ansh_58656: i am thinking of making the simplest mpu with transisitors
ansh_58656: i have watched ben eater and global science network
ansh_58656: its just around 1000 transisitors
ansh_58656: 100 capacitors and resistors
ansh_58656: and some potentiometers and leds
ansh_58656: and 5000000 gazillion wires
ansh_58656: and guess
ansh_58656: what???
ansh_58656: i dont have these components in the right amount
ansh_58656: not even one
ansh_58656: except for leds
tuvalutorture: use vacuum tubes instead of transistors like a REAL computer engineer
tuvalutorture: j
ansh_58656: no i dont have enought power at my home
ansh_58656: if i use vacum tubes at your home then instead of lowering the power it should boost the input voltages to the appliances from like 800 w to 1800 w
ansh_58656: who wants to develop a mpu with me????
tuvalutorture: hello nerds
tuvalutorture: I have returned from my nightly soda run
tuvalutorture: with a gallon of diabetes juice
tuvalutorture: I intend to consume in one night
tuvalutorture: (about 4 litres for those using the superior metric system)
ansh_58656: wow
ansh_58656: u have stage 100 diabetes
ansh_58656: thats good
ansh_58656: how much is a gallon in liter
ansh_58656: 3 l are u kidding me
ansh_58656: thats like two bottles of coca cola
tuvalutorture: well erm akshually its diet soda so no diabetes because no sugar
ansh_58656: artificial sweetners
tuvalutorture: yes
ansh_58656: here
ansh_58656: Artificial sweeteners may be linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attack and stroke
tuvalutorture: well erm
tuvalutorture: heart attack can be cured
tuvalutorture: diabetes cant
tuvalutorture: so
tuvalutorture: weighing my options
tuvalutorture: one comes out on top
ansh_58656: stack
tuvalutorture: ?

ansh_58656: wth is ts
turrnut: It is a metaphor, a principle deduced using Occam's razor. some individuals, esurient or dogmatic they might be, are more often than not, seldomly appreciated even by the miniscule minority amongst ourselves. While the remaining population, who consistently and constantly exert themselves to amelioration and progression, are referred to being the forks in a soup, standing in stark contrast with the abhorrent and contentious dandruffs.
