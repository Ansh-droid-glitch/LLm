[8/21/2025 12:24 AM] turrnut
when emulating, attach an empty fat32 image file, see the [README](https://github.com/turrnutorg/beacon/blob/main/README.md) for more info

Speaking of time, y'alls time actually make sense because you dont use daylight savings 😭


[8/21/2025 7:31 PM] ansh_58656
Daylight saving???


[8/21/2025 7:31 PM] ansh_58656
What does that mean


[8/21/2025 7:31 PM] ansh_58656
Idk lol


[8/21/2025 7:32 PM] turrnut
some countries move their clock one hour forward in the summer


[8/21/2025 7:32 PM] tuvalutorture
daylight savings time is basically when the entire US decides to change their clocks by an hour for no reason every 6 months (I think)


[8/21/2025 7:32 PM] ansh_58656
Ok


[8/21/2025 7:32 PM] turrnut
the US uses daylight savings except for Arizona and Hawaii, and @tuvalutorture lives in Arizona


[8/21/2025 7:32 PM] ansh_58656
Now i know


[8/21/2025 7:32 PM] turrnut
yea


[8/21/2025 7:32 PM] tuvalutorture

Daylight saving time by country
Daylight saving time (DST), also known as summer time, is the practice of advancing clocks during part of the year, typically by one hour around spring and summer, so that daylight ends at a later time of the day. As of 2025, DST is observed in most of Europe, most of North America and parts of Africa and Asia around the Northern Hemisphere summ...

@TURRNUT


[8/21/2025 7:40 PM] tuvalutorture
“Adios” is goodbye in Spanish


[8/21/2025 7:40 PM] ansh_58656

Bye


[8/22/2025 3:43 PM] ansh_58656
Hello


[8/22/2025 3:44 PM] ansh_58656
I ll also learn c


[8/22/2025 3:44 PM] tuvalutorture
hello


[8/22/2025 3:44 PM] ansh_58656
I only know cpp and python


[8/22/2025 3:44 PM] tuvalutorture
eh then you're already halfway there i'd say lol


[8/22/2025 3:44 PM] ansh_58656
How


[8/22/2025 3:45 PM] ansh_58656
Idk c


[8/22/2025 3:45 PM] ansh_58656
Oh u mean bcz of cpp


[8/22/2025 3:45 PM] ansh_58656
Idk i have never use c


[8/22/2025 3:46 PM] tuvalutorture
cause CPP is just built on top of C - all C code is CPP code
they share a lot of similarities
and python is somewhat similar in some ways (different in others too)
so i'd say in terms of how to write C you're kinda partially there already
just need to adapt to specifically C quirks


[8/22/2025 3:46 PM] ansh_58656
U joined chadderbox


[8/22/2025 3:46 PM] tuvalutorture
yep


[8/22/2025 3:46 PM] ansh_58656
Ok


[8/22/2025 3:47 PM] ansh_58656
Hmm


[8/22/2025 3:47 PM] ansh_58656
What do u think about asm


[8/22/2025 3:47 PM] ansh_58656
People say its hard but i think its kind of ok


[8/22/2025 3:47 PM] ansh_58656
Not that hard


[8/22/2025 3:48 PM] tuvalutorture
not hard necessarily
just
...painful
would be the right term


[8/22/2025 3:48 PM] tuvalutorture
in my opinion


[8/22/2025 3:48 PM] ansh_58656
Its jus moving values to different regsiters


[8/22/2025 3:49 PM] ansh_58656
Btw i loved that laptop img u sent on chadderbox


[8/22/2025 3:49 PM] ansh_58656
I love retro things


[8/22/2025 3:49 PM] tuvalutorture
yeah but for anything remotely complex it's a LOT of moving values - so at least from my experience it stacks up very quickly
like its not hard 
just a lot of manual stuff


[8/22/2025 3:49 PM] tuvalutorture
thank you :D
i too enjoy retro things


[8/22/2025 3:51 PM] ansh_58656
Idk what more to talk about


[8/22/2025 3:51 PM] tuvalutorture

I aked turrnut and he said idk


[8/22/2025 3:55 PM] ansh_58656

[8/22/2025 3:56 PM] tuvalutorture

[8/22/2025 3:56 PM] ansh_58656

[8/22/2025 4:48 PM] ansh_58656
Class like the school class


[8/22/2025 4:49 PM] tuvalutorture
uuuhhh i mean like
i have a few classes
if you're asking what year i'm in (like what grade)
9th grade / high school


[8/22/2025 4:51 PM] ansh_58656
Yeag grade


[8/22/2025 4:52 PM] tuvalutorture
then yeah 9th grade / year 9


[8/22/2025 4:52 PM] ansh_58656
My exams are starting from September


[8/22/2025 4:53 PM] tuvalutorture
i have no idea when my exams happen


[8/22/2025 4:53 PM] tuvalutorture
they usually happen in like april tho


[8/22/2025 5:53 PM] ansh_58656
Mine 1st sem in like September and 2nd sem in like jan to feb


[8/22/2025 7:23 PM] ansh_58656



[8/22/2025 7:23 PM] ansh_58656
U have an mac on the table


[8/22/2025 7:24 PM] tuvalutorture
no it’s just a monitor
not a Mac


[8/22/2025 7:29 PM] turrnut
yea cuz assembly is like different for different CPU architectures


[8/22/2025 7:30 PM] turrnut
yes


[8/22/2025 7:32 PM] turrnut
also @tuvalutorture  you got into programming through me? I thought you already knew python


[8/22/2025 7:33 PM] turrnut
also @Ansh in India is it that a grade is divided into a few classes and then you stay in that class and teachers come into the classroom


[8/22/2025 7:33 PM] turrnut
because I used to go to school in China and that's how it worked


[8/22/2025 7:33 PM] turrnut
but then in US it's the students that move around instead of teachers


[8/22/2025 7:41 PM] ansh_58656

many ppl in my class think they are programmers bcz of the robotics lab but its till block coding and when i tell em i kniw coding in python there 1st question - what is python? after i tell em its a programming lang they think im lying bcz im just a 11yr old kid that studies in 5th grade

hello


[8/23/2025 7:51 PM] turrnut
ok so technically they consider block code languages languages, but come on as people who have touched text based languages we all know that block code aren't real languages and it's basically for little kids to start learning to code


[8/23/2025 7:54 PM] turrnut
and yea it seems they're too ignorant to know python is a thing
you're ahead of people in your age group


[8/23/2025 7:54 PM] turrnut

we love Turbo C


[8/23/2025 10:04 PM] ansh_58656

[8/23/2025 10:05 PM] tuvalutorture
which is 16-bit real mode


[8/23/2025 10:05 PM] ansh_58656
i just use gcc


[8/23/2025 10:05 PM] ansh_58656
ok


[8/23/2025 10:05 PM] ansh_58656
now ik


[8/23/2025 10:06 PM] ansh_58656
what ure talkin bout


[8/23/2025 10:06 PM] ansh_58656
bro dont u have electricity bill like turned on ur comp for 19 days


[8/23/2025 10:07 PM] tuvalutorture
that is a
very good point


[8/23/2025 10:07 PM] ansh_58656
indeed


[8/23/2025 10:10 PM] tuvalutorture
consider
the following:
solar panels


[8/23/2025 10:10 PM] ansh_58656
and


[8/23/2025 10:10 PM] ansh_58656
just solar panel what bout night


[8/23/2025 10:12 PM] tuvalutorture
fun fact
any electricity not used while using solar panels (like if I used 1000w but they provided 2000w per hour)
gets sent to the electric company
and they send that electricity BACK at night
and actually if you still don’t use it
you get paid the value of that electricity


[8/23/2025 10:12 PM] ansh_58656
what are u typing its taking an eternity


[8/23/2025 10:12 PM] ansh_58656
u live with ur parents


[8/23/2025 10:12 PM] tuvalutorture

[8/23/2025 10:29 PM] tuvalutorture
@TURRNUT don’t we actually have a beacon logo


[8/23/2025 10:29 PM] turrnut

[8/23/2025 10:31 PM] turrnut
some random person in the internet


[8/23/2025 10:31 PM] ansh_58656
like me


[8/23/2025 10:32 PM] turrnut
actually @tuvalutorture did u nuke the CSA thing


[8/23/2025 10:32 PM] ansh_58656
CSA??????????


[8/23/2025 10:32 PM] turrnut
if so then he basically didn't actually have any survived contributions


[8/23/2025 10:32 PM] tuvalutorture
eh I can go back and add his contribution back


[8/23/2025 10:32 PM] tuvalutorture
in the form of a built in app


[8/23/2025 10:33 PM] turrnut
why did u nuke the CSA though \:(


[8/23/2025 10:33 PM] turrnut
yea maybe you should


[8/23/2025 10:33 PM] ansh_58656
CSA??????????


[8/23/2025 10:33 PM] turrnut
add it as built in app


[8/23/2025 10:34 PM] turrnut
so SIMAS is compiled to CSA bytecode, which stands for Compiled SIMAS


[8/23/2025 10:34 PM] turrnut
there used to be CSA support in beacon


[8/23/2025 10:34 PM] tuvalutorture
it was weird, buggy, and a hackey solution


[8/23/2025 10:34 PM] ansh_58656
OH HE HELPED IN SIMAS


[8/23/2025 10:34 PM] turrnut
no it's not, the compiler handled imports


[8/23/2025 10:34 PM] tuvalutorture
at the end of the day we should focus on actual features


[8/23/2025 10:34 PM] ansh_58656
YEAH POSITIVE


[8/23/2025 10:34 PM] ansh_58656
THINGS


[8/23/2025 10:35 PM] tuvalutorture
you had to restart the os just to load in a new app
and the way the OS handled shit was weird in my opinion 
we should be able to make something better in the future I promise


[8/23/2025 10:35 PM] ansh_58656
whens the future coming???


[8/23/2025 10:35 PM] turrnut
in the README yes, but he also ported it into C


[8/23/2025 10:36 PM] ansh_58656
@tuvalutorture  eat cat food and start on the os


[8/23/2025 10:36 PM] turrnut
no, I mean like SIMASJS, for beacon we prob don't need the compiling


[8/23/2025 10:36 PM] turrnut
just an interpreter or JIT works


[8/23/2025 10:36 PM] turrnut
and yes I agree we could make something better, maybe just add CMAS directly to beacon


[8/23/2025 10:36 PM] tuvalutorture
here’s the thing 
it wasn’t SIMAS CSA files


[8/23/2025 10:37 PM] tuvalutorture
it was just C code compiled into apps


[8/23/2025 10:37 PM] tuvalutorture
they just shared the nae


[8/23/2025 10:37 PM] turrnut
I c


[8/23/2025 10:37 PM] tuvalutorture
*name


[8/23/2025 10:37 PM] ansh_58656
yeah ts where i dont know anything


[8/23/2025 10:37 PM] turrnut

[8/23/2025 10:37 PM] ansh_58656
or understand


[8/23/2025 10:37 PM] ansh_58656
hows it ur bad mb bcz idk anything


[8/23/2025 10:38 PM] turrnut
I forgot that the beacon CSA isn't actually SIMASJS CSA


[8/23/2025 10:38 PM] turrnut
well at least we still have the BrainF— I mean, BoyFriend programming language in beacon


[8/23/2025 10:38 PM] ansh_58656
hhh


[8/23/2025 10:38 PM] ansh_58656
brainfuc---


[8/23/2025 10:39 PM] tuvalutorture
the way it worked was
- compiled c code
- a python script would find the size
- it would make a header with the size ands header
- the OS would load it to a pre-set memory address
- execute


[8/23/2025 10:39 PM] ansh_58656

ok in that case adding CMAS  would be better


[8/23/2025 10:40 PM] ansh_58656
i wanna make a compiler in c++


[8/23/2025 10:40 PM] ansh_58656
how much time would that take


[8/23/2025 10:40 PM] ansh_58656
i wonder


[8/23/2025 10:40 PM] tuvalutorture
the issue was it was weird, buggy, relied on SERIAL TRANSFER (which is slow and hard to get on proper hw without buying cables)
it als didn’t work with our hdd support
I had to update two headers manually every time we added a new function
it ran in ring 0 so it would allow the user to do anything
and also it was written by ChatGPT so everything looked fine but wasn’t


[8/23/2025 10:41 PM] ansh_58656
chatgpt???


[8/23/2025 10:41 PM] ansh_58656
wth


[8/23/2025 10:41 PM] turrnut
do you mean compile to machine code? if you do use LLVM or it's really difficult


[8/23/2025 10:41 PM] tuvalutorture
yeah when I wrote that I didn’t know a lot of c so I used ChatGPT sometimes


[8/23/2025 10:42 PM] ansh_58656
no like makin my own lang


[8/23/2025 10:42 PM] turrnut
I can confirm since I can't even get it to work on windows


[8/23/2025 10:42 PM] ansh_58656
serial tranfer like serial like on the usb ports u guys kiddin me?


[8/23/2025 10:42 PM] turrnut
yea but are you doing a compiler or interpreter


[8/23/2025 10:42 PM] ansh_58656
need to think bcz compiler is faster


[8/23/2025 10:43 PM] ansh_58656
but interpreted is also good


[8/23/2025 10:43 PM] turrnut
also guys should we just make everything ring 0 only like templeos for the funnyz


[8/23/2025 10:43 PM] ansh_58656
wdym??


[8/23/2025 10:43 PM] tuvalutorture
as in COM1


[8/23/2025 10:44 PM] turrnut
if you compile to native machine code it's really hard, but if you use C++ to do it it's easier because you can use LLVM


[8/23/2025 10:44 PM] ansh_58656
yeah com3 serial ports


[8/23/2025 10:44 PM] tuvalutorture
nah it should be ring 3 when we can afford to write it because yk why


[8/23/2025 10:44 PM] ansh_58656
yeah using cpp only


[8/23/2025 10:45 PM] ansh_58656
what are u guys talkin bout??


[8/23/2025 10:45 PM] tuvalutorture
look up cpu privilege rings
it’s a protected mode 32 bit thing


[8/23/2025 10:45 PM] ansh_58656
oh  i asked chatgpt now ik


[8/23/2025 10:46 PM] ansh_58656

i can't believe it's just a burning memory (Full video)
[#2]
This meme went quite popular during July-August 2021 and i decided to finally upload a full video (without that weird black and white watermark in it) version of this meme.

Music is Heartaches by Al Bowlly. And for those wondering... i am the creator of the original meme. It just flew under my head back on my EATEOT times.

[8/24/2025 9:36 AM] tuvalutorture
changing the colors you can use "p" to switch to the color picker and "p" to switch back


[8/24/2025 9:36 AM] tuvalutorture
or you can use the mouse ofc

if i use vacum tubes at your home then instead of lowering the power it should boost the input voltages to the appliances from like 800 w to 1800 w

Artificial sweeteners may be linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attack and stroke


[8/24/2025 11:06 AM] tuvalutorture

heart attack can be cured

It is a metaphor, a principle deduced using Occam's razor. some individuals, esurient or dogmatic they might be, are more often than not, seldomly appreciated even by the miniscule minority amongst ourselves.  While the remaining population, who consistently and constantly exert themselves to amelioration and progression, are referred to being the forks in a soup, standing in stark contrast with the abhorrent and contentious dandruffs.

[9/8/2025 4:50 PM] tuvalutorture
a wee java


[9/8/2025 4:50 PM] tuvalutorture
(codehs practice)


[9/8/2025 4:50 PM] tuvalutorture
and i have come to realize


[9/8/2025 4:50 PM] tuvalutorture
java


[9/8/2025 4:50 PM] tuvalutorture
is just


[9/8/2025 4:50 PM] tuvalutorture
hyper-bloated C


[9/8/2025 4:50 PM] tuvalutorture
that's it


[9/8/2025 4:50 PM] turrnut
my school is using codehs as well I think


[9/8/2025 4:50 PM] tuvalutorture
its just C


[9/8/2025 4:50 PM] turrnut
also yea that's fair tbh


[9/8/2025 4:50 PM] tuvalutorture
but with enough abstractions to kill a horse


[9/8/2025 4:50 PM] turrnut
but it's just with classes


[9/8/2025 4:50 PM] turrnut
Java has a lot of abstractions


[9/8/2025 4:50 PM] tuvalutorture

[9/8/2025 4:51 PM] turrnut
yes


[9/8/2025 4:51 PM] turrnut
which is why it's mostly used to write enterprise level applications rather than simple program


[9/8/2025 4:51 PM] tuvalutorture
wanna get the length of a string? oh its not strlen(string), no, that's too fuckin easy, use string.length(), bitch

[9/9/2025 1:19 AM] turrnut
wait so you don't have any Google Forms?


[9/9/2025 1:20 AM] turrnut
come on now


[9/9/2025 1:20 AM] turrnut
physical attractiveness is not the only factor


[9/9/2025 1:20 AM] turrnut
I won't like a girl just because she's hot


[9/9/2025 1:21 AM] turrnut
I'll say yea she's hot but to be gf/bf one needs more than that


[9/9/2025 1:21 AM] turrnut
it's more about the person's personality


[9/9/2025 1:22 AM] turrnut
stop thinking that you'll never get a gf just because you're ugly


[9/9/2025 1:22 AM] turrnut
work on yourself


[9/9/2025 1:22 AM] turrnut
plus, I disagree with *anyone* who say that anyone is ugly because...


[9/9/2025 1:22 AM] turrnut
everyone is beautiful in their own ways

[9/15/2025 10:17 AM] tuvalutorture
guys hear me out


[9/15/2025 10:17 AM] tuvalutorture
so I’ve got a calculator


[9/15/2025 10:17 AM] tuvalutorture
a ti nspire cx


[9/15/2025 10:17 AM] tuvalutorture
what if


[9/15/2025 10:17 AM] tuvalutorture
beacon


[9/15/2025 10:17 AM] tuvalutorture
on


[9/15/2025 10:17 AM] tuvalutorture
the calculator


[9/15/2025 10:17 AM] tuvalutorture
to do fun shit


[9/15/2025 10:17 AM] tuvalutorture
during class


[9/15/2025 10:17 AM] tuvalutorture
the nspire


[9/15/2025 10:18 AM] tuvalutorture
can also be emulated online


[9/15/2025 10:18 AM] tuvalutorture
meaning


[9/15/2025 10:18 AM] tuvalutorture
testing is easy


[9/15/2025 10:18 AM] tuvalutorture
AND


[9/15/2025 10:18 AM] tuvalutorture
the nspire


[9/15/2025 10:18 AM] tuvalutorture
has a screen


[9/15/2025 10:18 AM] tuvalutorture
of 320x240


[9/15/2025 10:18 AM] tuvalutorture
not dissimilar


[9/15/2025 10:18 AM] tuvalutorture
of the VGA mode 13h


[9/15/2025 10:18 AM] tuvalutorture
(and it matches the hackey mode X)


[9/15/2025 10:18 AM] tuvalutorture
meaning


[9/15/2025 10:19 AM] tuvalutorture
we could use the calculator version


[9/15/2025 10:19 AM] tuvalutorture
to test out


[9/15/2025 10:19 AM] tuvalutorture
more colours


[9/15/2025 10:19 AM] tuvalutorture
and graphical features


[9/15/2025 10:19 AM] tuvalutorture
before we work on adding them


[9/15/2025 10:19 AM] tuvalutorture
to the main beacon repo


[9/15/2025 10:19 AM] tuvalutorture
not only that


[9/15/2025 10:19 AM] tuvalutorture
the nspire


[9/15/2025 10:19 AM] tuvalutorture
has a thing


[9/15/2025 10:19 AM] tuvalutorture
called Ndless


[9/15/2025 10:19 AM] tuvalutorture
which allows


[9/15/2025 10:20 AM] tuvalutorture
you to run


[9/15/2025 10:20 AM] tuvalutorture
C code


[9/15/2025 10:20 AM] tuvalutorture
on the calculator


[9/15/2025 10:20 AM] tuvalutorture
